# Report summary

Our dataset has information on almost 4700+ Houses/Apartments/Flats Available for Rent in India. We have explored how some important features like releasing time, size, location, and number of rooms will influence the rental. The results show that rent price of a property is affected by multiple factors, and some of the relationships are more complex than linear.

Ihe Rental Market Boosts in India, and it becomes a problem
The Economic Times released an article at Auguest 2022 titled It’s time to be a greedy landlord amid India’s rental housing demand boom, indicating that India has seen a major spike in rental demand, resulting in a rise in residential rentals. "Indian rental housing searches grew 84.4% year-on-year in the second quarter of this year and 29.4% on sequential basis. Moreover, the cumulative rental housing listings increased 3% quarter-on-quarter and 28.1% on year across 13 Indian cities mapped." The rental market is going crazy in India.
Therefore, our goal is to explore potential factors that influence rent price. We could help tenants understanding the rental market, and both tenants and landords in reasonable pricing prediction.
